        <h2>Anime Expos</h2>
          <p>For 3 years straight, I would go to New York's Comic Con and LA's Anime Expo. Obviously, last year was a no go due to Covid, but I'm hoping this year will go back to normal.</p>

        <h2>Movies Just As Good As The Mangas</h2>
          <p>Attack on Titan is one of the classics! This is the 1st anime I had my whole family watch. I can proudly say my sister is just as hooked as I am.</p>
          <p>My Hero Academia was the second anime I watched. My sister and I are the only ones in the family who watched it. This past summer, we binged all 4 seasons and are waiting to watch season 5 this year.</p>

        <h2>Japan!</h2>
          <p>My dad and I took a guys' trip to Japan. We ate tons of my favorites: ramen, udon, and sushi. The highlight of the trip was when we went to the famous Akihabara Crossing in Tokyo... it was like the heavens opened! Akihabara has 10 floors filled with shops specializing in anime, manga (anime comic books), and video games!</p>
          <p>Demon Slayer is my ultimate favorite! Can't wait for season 2!</p>
